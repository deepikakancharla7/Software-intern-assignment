In-Memory File System


Overview
This is a simple implementation of an in-memory file system in Python that supports basic file and directory operations. The file system provides functionalities such as creating directories, changing the current directory, listing directory contents, searching for patterns in files, displaying file contents, creating empty files, moving, copying, and removing files or directories.

Features
mkdir: Create a new directory.
cd: Change the current directory.
ls: List the contents of the current or specified directory.
grep: Search for a specified pattern in a file.
cat: Display the contents of a file.
touch: Create a new empty file.
echo: Write text to a file.
mv: Move a file or directory to another location.
cp: Copy a file or directory to another location.
rm: Remove a file or directory.


Usage
Running the Program:
Execute the main function in the provided Python script.
bash
Copy code
python script.py
Command Line Interface:
Enter commands in the interactive command-line interface, following the specified syntax for each operation.
bash
Copy code
/ $ mkdir my_directory
/ $ cd my_directory
/ $ touch my_file.txt
/ $ ls
my_file.txt
/ $ echo 'Hello, World!' > my_file.txt
/ $ cat my_file.txt
Hello, World!
Saving and Loading State:
To save the current state:
bash
Copy code
python script.py "{'save_state': 'true', 'path': 'file_system_state.json'}"
To load a saved state:
bash
Copy code
python script.py "{'load_state': 'true', 'path': 'file_system_state.json'}"

File System State
The file system state is saved and loaded in JSON format. The state includes the current working directory and the structure of the file system.

Requirements
Python (version X.X.X)
Improvements and Notes
The code uses the os and json modules for file system and JSON operations.
Security precautions have been taken to handle errors gracefully and prevent security vulnerabilities.
Special commands for saving and loading state are provided for persistence across sessions.
Error messages are displayed for invalid commands or operations.
